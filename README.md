# Data-Structure-Algorithms
This is a study plan for Data Structure &amp; Algorithms.

##

## Programming Language 
Basically you can use any Programming Language  for Data-Structure-Algorithms but here I'm using Python.

## Python
To learn Python I refer this playlist by Corey Schafer [Learn-Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYXdXT2l-Gg&list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU)

## Books
- [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118290275/)
    - by Goodrich, Tamassia, Goldwasser
    - I loved this book. It covered everything and more.
    
- [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844)
    - This book is a great review of algorithms and data structures, but won't teach you how to write good code. You have to be able to code a decent solution efficiently, aka CLR, sometimes CLRS, because Stein was late to the game
    

## Algorithmic complexity / Big-O / Asymptotic analysis
Big-O measures the run time of algorithm as the size of input data increases.
